One of my dreams is to attend such an occasion. When I heard of it, I thought of what it would be like at an event like this. I was very moved because I'll be able to meet programmers who code in Python mostly. However, fulfilling my interest at this moment would cost me a business that I can't afford. We aren't that wealthy, so we tend to set aside frist the things for enjoyment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a pleasant day. I had an internet connection at that time, so I checked my twitter. The official twitter account of PyCon APAC twitted something that made me send them a message. It was just a simple tweet saying that I can send them a message to that email address. I sent them a letter, of course, I would lose nothing doing so. Whenever I go home from school, I start my laptop immediately. If I have an internet connection, I check everything that is mattering. I viewed my emails, and there was this message saying that I got invited in PyCon APAC 2019. I was very exhilarated! It was like I graduated from college at an early age. They had also given me financial aid, so I no longer bothered about our fair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>23rd of February, it was the first day of the exciting event. I got my older sister with me. We were already in front of iAcademy Nexus -- the truly comfortable and elegant school I have ever been so far. Everyone was very courteous. They will give you assistance when you're in need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can see Python as the most used programming language for machine learning, and that reflected on the talks. Python is indeed, very dominant in the field. There were also automation, web development and some other technologies to foster harnessing the power of Python. I mainly do web development with Django and Vue. Nevertheless, my mind got preoccupied with the tens of Python in machine learning, enough to motivate me to delve into the field. I met programmers who are very astonishing in coding. I can see other coders who are already far, light years away from me. Despite that distance, they did still share excellent knowledge, and that was a pure, benevolent heart. The talks made me think of employment. From that time, I wanted to get my very own job, honestly. I had been wakened up as well by the fact that I still lack experiences. I must improve myself more in some areas that the event showed me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if I have advanced knowledge of coding, there were still moments when I can't catch up with the things that the speakers say. Those talks that were about machine learning were a bit hard to relate with, especially if you haven't yet really tried it before. Despite my weak pick-up, I still did build my interest in that field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My impressions inside the building were very light. Being surrounded by people who have superpowers felt so excellent. Currently, I miss the programmers, even if I did not talk too much there, I still miss seeing the programmers, viewing them is somewhat satisfying. Big thanks to the Python Software Foundation and other sponsors who made the event happen excellently, and to the Python Philippines Community. One of the most memorable, astounding and rewarding events in my entire life.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",preview_content:"I have never been in a conference before.

It is the key to success and the one-way ticket to employment. Technology nowadays can be applied to anything, including serving education to learners who are willing to achieve something in their lives. Electronic learning is a kind of studying method which involves incorporating the use of technology to ease the delivery of knowledge. It could be getting learning resources online, or physical devices to help in teaching. With technology, education has the chance to evolve into something that is much more convenient to be attained by anyone who is in need of it. The study identifies the advantages and disadvantages of technology in education. Like finding for reading materials is now easy because of the search engines online. However, not all you read on the Internet is real. You can find skills on the Internet, they could be your major skills or your minor skills only. Employment depends on whatever skills you have, technology helps you getting what you need. The statement of the problem is about how to distribute knowledge in an easier way. The study was built with scientific and naturalistic approaches. It does not persuade nor disapprove electronic learning, but somewhat give information on what it can provide for the betterment of the evolution of education. It has taken a development period of one month and a half. The study will prove that there are now lots of universities and schools that are already implementing electronic learning, and have the major use of the Internet. The study will also show that computer-related jobs are in-demand. The study has taken place in Educational Systems Technological Institute Incorporated of Boac, Marinduque. It has 5 research questions that were answered by 50 exceptionally nice respondents. The researchers had to create their own online-test website for gathering data. The study will also prove that there are more hindrances in learning, not just money, distance or anything else. With the great efforts of the researchers, they were able to extract interesting results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/38" target="_blank">Introduction</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/40/" target="_blank">Review of Related Literature</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/41/" target="_blank">Methodology</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://needyourhelp.herokuapp.com/report/" target="_blank">Survey Report</a></p>\r\n<p class="w3-small w3-opacity">Written in British English.</p>',preview_content:"The researchers had to create their own online-test website for gathering data.

And to better describe and explain the gathered data. The research design is not experimental. The design was helpful in determining whether students or employed people prefer electronic learning or do they recommend it to others, think of it as beneficial, does this train them in becoming a better employer, and in finding out the hindrances in studying.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Research Locale</h2>\r\n<p>The study was conducted in Education Systems technological Institute Incorporated of Boac, Marinduque. The school adopts electronic learning and the researches found that it is a quite good area to start the research. The institution features two computer laboratories which are busy all the time and give less time to students whose strand requires more in using computers. Teachers provide their own laptops in teaching and do not use a projector and white screen board.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Sampling</h2>\r\n<p>The study uses simple random sampling which is under the probability sampling and unbiased sampling. Anyone was able to give their responses because the online-test accepts all kinds of people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data Gathering Procedure</h2>\r\n<p>The researchers developed their own online-test website that the respondents will visit to lay their responses. After the development, the researchers tediously sent the link of the website to random people - student and non-student. They also posted the link to social platforms to further promote the website. With those efforts, the study was able to obtain the desired rate of responses.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Statistical Treatment of Data</h2>\r\n<p>In the first question which is, "do you prefer learning online?", 20 answered "maybe", 23 answered "yes" and 7 answered "No". We will use the formula: number of respondents who responded the answer multiplied to 100 then divided to the total number of respondents. Using the formula, it was concluded that 40% of the respondents were not certain to whether they prefer online learning, 46% of them did prefer online learning and 14% of them did not.</p>\r\n<p>In the second question which is, "how would you recommend it to other learners?", 35 recommended it, 8 recommended it very much and 7 did not recommend it. We will use the same formula applied in the first question. It showed that 70% recommended it, 16% recommended it very much and 14% did not recommend it.</p>\r\n<p>In the third question which is, "do you think online learning is beneficial to learners?", 29 answered "yes", 19 answered "maybe" and 2 answered "no". We will use again the formula in the first question, it explained that 58% did believe that online learning is beneficial, 38% were not certain and 4% said that online learning is not beneficial.</p>\r\n<p>In the fourth question that asks for the hindrances in learning, there were 17 points for the distance between the home and school, 16 points for the money problem, 11 points for the will to learn and 26 points for other factors. In this question, we will not be applying any formula because the results are already based on the points. All factors have their points and it was surprising for the researchers because the points were near to each other except the other factors, it means that there are a lot of hindrances in learning, not just the will to learn, the financial problem and distance.</p>\r\n<p>In the fifth question and the last which is, "does learning online train you well for being an employable person?", 9 said that it does, 4 answered that it does not and 37 responded that it depends on their situations. In this question, we will be applying the same formula used in the first question, 18% of the respondents believed that learning online does train you well in becoming an employable person, 8% of the respondents did not believe that and 74% of the respondents said that it all depends on the situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Respondent of the Study</h2>\r\n<p>There were 50 random respondents who nicely gave their responses. Most of them are from ESTI, while some are from different schools. The researchers included some other catalysts to avoid having biased results.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Research Instrument</h2>\r\n<p>The researches have their online-test website. They also used social media platforms, Facebook and Twitter - to be more specific. And a digital calculator for expressing the treatment of data gathered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/42/" target="_blank">Abstract</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/38" target="_blank">Introduction</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/40/" target="_blank">Review of Related Literature</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://needyourhelp.herokuapp.com/report/" target="_blank">Survey Report</a></p>\r\n<p class="w3-small w3-opacity">Written in British English.</p>',preview_content:"The study uses both qualitative and quantitative styles to include the views of the researchers and respondents.

The day-to-day administration and most of the University procedures are carried out online. The University Management System (UMS), an online portal of the university, is one such innovative step of the university to provide vital information regarding academics and other university logistics for assisting the university students, their parents and the staff.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past universities and large school districts, in particular, have created their own spoken student record system (Wikipedia 2014). One such example is the Repository of Student Information CROSI system of University of Toronto with growing complexity in the business of educational establishments most organizations now choose to buy customizable software and increasing numbers are buying software as a service (SAAS). Most student information systems that are used today are server-based.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the application residing on a certain computer, the server is being accessed by client applications at various places with and in even outside the school. But student information systems have been moving to the web since the late 1990s and that trend is accelerating as institutions replace the older system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pointing out that teachers\' roles in online education have not been extensively examined. Wallace (2003) emphasized the crucial role teachers had in "facilitating discussion providing direct instruction and giving feedback to students" future research she suggested, should focus more or exploring "The relationship of teacher\'s presence and immediacy to student engagement in knowledge construction and to student learning". She also reviewed ways to collaborate online to encourage students in creating an online learning community to be actively participating in the process, which she stressed, was essential to the success of students\' online learning. In addition, she raised several serious questions for future research such as investigating whether an online learning community had any different impact on students\' learning outcomes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In attempting to examine who uses online education and why they choose it Tallert Runnels and Colleagues (2006) found that such learners were, one: mostly non-traditional students, who were older than normal college – age students, two: were highly motivated, goal- oriented and determined to achieve good learning outcomes from online education, and three: they normally had important roles in their local communities. After reviewing 76 students on online teaching Tallent – Runnels and Colleagues (2006) examined the course of environmental proposed findings similar to Wallace (2003) on the benefits of creating an online learning community that foster small discussion groups and effective communication methods. In such a process, they emphasized teaching presence was highly important because immediate feedback and responses from instructors were critical to students\' learning - a factor that contributed to students\' satisfaction with their courses. Although they agreed on the importance of instruction –students interaction they routed that because of the relatively small samples of participants in most studies they reviewed, it was necessary to be cautious about generalizing research results when applied to a larger population. They pointed out that so far, no empirical studies were able to illustrate that online learning was more effective than the face-to-face learning method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professional development is still an investment, but it\'s easier and cheaper than it was in the past with e-learning. Instead of requiring employees to attend a meeting at the same time and paying someone to come and teach on a specific topic, employees can do self-paced online courses. Employees are more likely to be engaged with the courses if they can fit them around their own schedules. The workday can be unpredictable, and if they\'re able to squeeze a lesson in during some downtime, it\'s much better for productivity than everyone stopping work at once. It\'s possible for the development to take place without a huge investment and without leaving the office for a class or conference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the job field, the very highlighted beneficiaries of electronic learning are those people whose current works right now are related to the tech world. According to LifeHack.org, there are five abilities that can be mastered online and they are: mathematics, statistics and data analysis, cloud computing, logistics, digital marketing, and programming. As time develops into its very precious, dealing with data becomes more important. Companies today hire data analysts and data scientist to predict their future stock price. One of the major changes in technology is the move from local hosting to cloud-hosted services. In a tough economy, logistics, also known as the science of supply chain management, is a crucial tool for product-based companies. It is the responsibility of the supply chain manager to minimize the cost of sourcing raw materials, production and distribution of consumer products. About every major business area has undergone massive changes in the last ten years and marketing is no different. If you haven’t gotten the memo yet, the print is drowning and online marketing is the future. So, more than ever, businesses need people who understand the landscape of online marketing, which covers Search Engine Optimization (SEO), content marketing, and social media. Programming is the very process of creating software, none of those mentioned skills above will come to life without this. If you know how to program, you are valuable to the current employment world since coders are in-demand as they are very flexible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online learning is for all, you can learn almost everything through the Internet. However, not all professions can be mastered in learning online. But, this can help you in building the auxiliary skills you want which will help you with what job you have. Online learning provides a quick way of learning, making you sure that you will be kept up-to-date to the current trends of the world especially in employment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/42/" target="_blank">Abstract</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/38" target="_blank">Introduction</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/41/" target="_blank">Methodology</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://needyourhelp.herokuapp.com/report/" target="_blank">Survey Report</a></p>\r\n<p class="w3-small w3-opacity">Written in British English.</p>',preview_content:"Online learning is for all, you can learn almost everything through the Internet.

It is where a person can get a basic to advanced knowledge, readying them to the job field they want. Education is designed to guide them in learning a culture, moulding their behaviour in the ways of adulthood, and directing them toward their eventual role in the society (Britanica 2019). Nowadays, education has been accelerated by combining technology with the conveyance of knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>Electronic learning refers to a broad educational concept primarily characterized by the use of electronic media and other types of communication technologies (ReadFast.co.uk 2012). It hastens the teaching process, making students adequately understand lessons. In addition, electronic learning increments the interactivity level between students and the teacher. This said interactivity, makes studying much better. This kind of learning has also increased the acquiring experience of students. Since that technology is flexible, education has been flexible as well. Learners access their favourite courses at any time through 24/7 accessibility and are able to learn from any quarter of the world. The only thing needed is a good technological medium like computer, laptop or tablet to assist them in their learning process. Electronic learning also implements easy storage. When they learn online, students are not bound by traditional classroom settings with lecture notes and instructions of teachers in a physical environment.  They can go in for any number of details, sources, research material and learning tools in the electronic learning process and thus find it highly useful for improving their knowledge. They are able to collect what they wish in the subject and thus are able to move forward without a struggle in their courses. This helps them get unique insights in topics and get on without annoyance.</p>\r\n<p>While learning electronically is transcendent, there are still some hurdles hindering students from learning. There are still schools in the Philippines that lack electronic learning materials (ELearningIndustry.com 2019). Most of the students do not have access to the Internet and only rely upon their "Free Data". Even right now, some students are still struggling to use modern technology. The credibility of contents on the internet is not fully trusted, that is why not all teachers are getting their resources online and only tend to use the books. Some students live in very distant places that are far away from schools. Not all students have their personal computers where they can view and save their learning materials, and they still have to go to Internet Cafés to do so.</p>\r\n<p>Education is very important because this is one of the ways that will give a real living in the future. Each school must provide an electronic learning method because when this is coupled with the traditional way of teaching, learning becomes much interesting.  With the implementation of electronic learning in schools, they can really present the quality education that the students deserve, equipping them with the best of what they need.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Satement of the Problem</h2>\r\n<p>Improved and approachable education provided by schools and foster carriage of knowledge. Do you prefer learning online? How would you recommend it to other learners? Do you think learning online is beneficial to learners? What are those factors that hinder you in learning? Does learning online train you well for being an employable person?</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Significance of the Study</h2>\r\n<p>The findings of this study will bind in the significance of education in the society today. The importance of education in finding a stable and well-paid job will make students study about considering to attain a qualified education through the use of technology. The students will be presented ways of how to properly use technology to increase their knowledge. It will also carry the benefits of combining the traditional way of teaching with the aid of technology, presenting schools views why they must apply technology in teaching. The schools will meet ways of how to acquire electronic learning. For the researchers, the study will help them uncover new ways of how to better implement electronic or online learning in schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Scope and Delimitation</h2>\r\n<p>The study will be composed of scientific and naturalistic approaches, according to the primary data that the researchers themselves got from the respondents and other resources. It will identify the benefits of acquiring electronic learning in schools given to the students, not just those who are enrolled but for all aspiring learners. It also discusses the factors that hinder the learning process of pupils. The researchers have created their survey application online which enables them to gather data from Filipino learners around the Philippines. The study has begun on the 14th of January 2019, and it has already taken two weeks as of 26th of January 2019. It does not induce learners to learn electronically, or schools to provide electronic learning method, but to carry out what this can offer more to the present benefits of education. The study is beneficial for all learners and schools, and including the researchers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Definition of Terms</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><b>Free Data</b> - data that is limited and can be viewed freely without spending a balance in your internet connection.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Online</b> - controlled by or connected to another computer or to a network.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Internet</b> - also known as the information superhighway, it is the network of connected computers that share data.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Technology</b> - machinery and equipment developed from the application of scientific knowledge.</li>\r\n    <li><b>Education</b> - the process of receiving or giving systematic instruction, especially at a school or university.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/42/" target="_blank">Abstract</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/40/" target="_blank">Review of Related Literature</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://dsadian.herokuapp.com/blog/detail/41/" target="_blank">Methodology</a></p>\r\n<p><a class="w3-large w3-hover-text-pink w3-text-blue" href="https://needyourhelp.herokuapp.com/report/" target="_blank">Survey Report</a></p>\r\n<p class="w3-small w3-opacity">Written in British English.</p>',preview_content:"Education is one of the most important treasures in a person's life, especially for those students who are really willing to learn.

It may, and it may not. Others say that nothing is easy, but they do not say that all is hard. Programming is hard if you will think that it is hard, and the same thing if you will think of it as not. There are steps in learning programming. Those steps can make your learning easy. But those steps may vary on what you want in programming because it has different fields, just like in the world of medicine, doctors have their specialized areas. But in programming, you can enter all those fields if you want to. Anyway, we are not getting closer to our question. By the way, once again, the answer to our question above all depends on you. “How about you, what’s your answer?” – I like that question of yours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For me, programming is way too hard! When I was learning HTML, I was like, “Yo! This is so easy!” and I continue reading, then suddenly, I got punched in the face (not literally) that HTML won’t give you a lot if you are not going to learn JavaScript, CSS (just a styling language) and much more languages that will ready you up with all skills you need in web development. By the way, the very first field that I got myself into with was this, web development. I learned HTML, CSS and JS in <a href="https://w3schools.com" target="blank" class="w3-text-green w3-hover-text-light-green">W3Schools</a>. Such a nice website, it is. I thought myself as stupid that time by the way because I was getting myself into web development without having a consistent internet connection. I’m not yet able to get my very own stable internet connection that time, and that made me said these words, “Boy, learning programming is hard”. Why did I say those words? Well, I get all of my stuff from the internet and If I don’t have money for me to go in an internet café, learning programming will be paused for a while, until I have my own money again and I’ll quickly go to the nearest internet café, not playing games but downloading tons of PDFs and other programs for learning. If you’re like me, I feel you so much. Good thing that some knowledge in web development can be earned by just studying offline, but it’s much better if you have an internet connection. That was one of my greatest hindrances in learning programming. Also, when I was learning JS, I was like, “This is so easy”, read and read again, and do some small kinds of stuff by my own, then suddenly, “Wait, I can no longer remember the topics, I’ll grab the learning resources again.” Tutorials nowadays have their panels where steps in learning are organized, following that helps a lot. Skipping lessons is foolish. Over-reading is somewhat, not that good, as it will bombard your brain with information and believe me, the result of that is, you’ll end up forgetting them quickly, it’s like your brain will vomit all you have read. Try to take everything slowly, like what they say, “Slowly but surely”. Do not ever skip a lesson without understanding it completely, you will only give yourself a headache in your following lessons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now I was done with web development. The next thing I did was learning Python, which I currently use in back-end programming. I learned it from the <a href="https://sololearn.com" target="blank" class="w3-text-green w3-hover-text-pink">SoloLearn</a> app. Its syntax is very nice, the “elegant” word fits it well. After weeks, I now know Python, but it’s still not over, in fact, learning programming is eternal, technology evolves each and every time, which you have to cope with. Frameworks come in (especially in JS). The hardest frameworks that I’ve learned in Python was the Django. It is huge, but it’s nice, some hard works will be taken care for you, so you can focus on what really matters a lot. And it has batteries included, it has built-in modules that will make your life easy, but learning it is not easy because like what I’ve said, it is huge, but hey, all pays well at the end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only Python but Java, C#, Kotlin, VB, C and C++ as well. I learned them because I want to experience coding using them, but I have not developed any fascinating programs using them, except Python and JS, maybe only one in C#, it was a simple “alien” game. The good thing in programming is that, once you have mastered the concepts in one programming language, it will be just easy to learn other languages, since almost all languages share the same concepts like OOP, procedures, storages and much more. Python was the first language that taught me OOP, and moving to other languages like Java, was not that hard (but not easy). People think that programming is very hard like a black diamond because they have to learn a lot of languages. But the fact is, you really don’t have to learn all of the programming languages that you hear from other people. All depends on what field you want, like web development, you’ll need pure JS and PHP or Python. Did I say anything about C or C++? Nope. Here’s one as well, try speaking English in China, will you find English as useful? Nope. It’s just picking the needed languages for what situation you are currently dealing with. The same thing with frameworks (these are programs for programmers that make things much easier). Study one framework that you feel comfortable with, once you feel that you’re ready to study others, then go ahead, just don’t learn them all at the same time because it is nonsense.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some will say that it is hard, some will not. It sometimes depends on how you quickly understand words and how great your motivation is. Don’t fill up your mind with negative thoughts. The truth is, learning programming is a very long way. But do not get discouraged because everyone can learn to programme, and they can achieve what they want if they give nice effort. <b><i>Programming may hate sometimes, but it is just its other way of telling you that you must not give up on it.</i></b></p>\r\n\r\n<p class="w3-opacity w3-small">Credits to the picture.</p>',preview_content:"It is, and it is not.

I knew nothing but copy and paste because that’s the very first thing that my sister taught me about computers. She told me that I was not good with computers and I was dumb of it. And so I promised to myself that I’ll learn more than just copy and paste.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Internet is one of the most important learning resources. It was 2015 and I was just 14. I taught myself how to program with the aid of our Internet Laboratory in our High School. I was the frequent visitor of our laboratory. Every recess time in our school, I go there and search for different programming languages. I had to choose what programming language that I should learn, and I picked Java. When I was learning Java, I thought Java and JavaScript were all the same, and I wasn’t aware that I was learning JavaScript from W3Schools.com instead of Java. I got very confused that time so I stopped learning to programme. But I still want to learn to programme though. I chose another programming language to learn, and that was Python. I got amazed by its syntax, it’s short and easy to understand, and it has its own interpreter where you can test codes and view documentation when in doubt. Python was the very first language that I learned successfully. After Python, I learned JavaScript, Turbo Pascal, Java, Kotlin, C# and still learning more. Now, my skills in a computer are better than my sisters, and now I have developed 33 programs in Python.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Programming is a very important process in creating programs. It is fun, but most of the time, it gives a headache, but in that headache, there’s a light full of rewards. Everyone can learn how to program, they just have to do some effort and not quit because those who quit are lazy.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>',preview_content:"When I was an elementary student, computer for me was just for gaming and adult stuffs.

Did you know that this is where we combine animation, photo designing and editing? And of course, our beloved programming (though it does not love us back sometimes). We might deal a lot with hardware in some situations, like if you want to career developing games in Malls (e.g. Time Zone, Tom’s World, etc.), you have to design the physical form of the game where you will upload the software, the drivers for intricate devices besides from joysticks and monitors. However, game development is not that easy, it is hard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like what we all say, there is no easy field, well if you oppose that statement, I guess you’re a professional already. Not to discourage you from liking game development, but the reality is, games just follow with the trend and people’s desires. If they want action games, then they will tend to download and install Cardo-like games. Just like the popular game right now, which is the Mobile Legends. You also have to consider what devices do people mostly use, in this era right now, their worlds go around with their mobile phones, running Android, iOS, or I don’t know, maybe some Windows, to ensure that your game will run anywhere. You must also have targets like whether your game is for children, or for adults. But right now, most games that can be downloaded from the internet can be played by all, they are not gender or age specific. In developing your game, you must create your plan, choose what programming language/s you will use, and what programs that will help you through the process. C# and C++ are the most used languages for game development, but some other languages are used as well, like Python (Disney uses this for their games), JavaScript, and Java. If you’ll choose C#, then you have to go with the Unity game engine. Else if you want to go with C++, you have to choose Unreal. In Python, PyGame is the frequently used library. I don’t know what they use in JavaScript and Java since that I haven’t yet performed game development using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<style>.embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }</style><div class='embed-container'><iframe src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/R-Ukt9BVw-o' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n<p>It takes mastery of a programming language in order to develop games comfortably. Watch videos on the internet about the development of your favourite games to give you motivation, and for you to gather real bits of advice about game development. There are a lot of fields involved with computers, and game development is one of them. Learning this kind of development will cost a lot of time for you to master the concepts, from sprites to communication between scripts. Everything is patience. There is always a long way towards your goal. There is no shortcut to success, well if there is, maybe your success will not be a success at all, it could be just filled with pain and regrets caused by guesses and bugs.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>",preview_content:"Yes, it really is.

Well, all of our favourite Social Medias have undergone web development. It is the process wherein we build web pages and combine them as a whole, known as a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this process, we encounter databases where we manage our users’ data. We will also meet designing of pages and considering how contents are displayed or viewed. And the most intriguing part is, securing the whole. In web development, there are three languages that must be kept in mind, and they are HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JS (JavaScript). These three languages are the very foundation of web development. A web page is a single document and a website is a collection of web pages that are bind together because of their relatedness. The “website” word is not the plural form for web pages, it is just a term for identifying connected web pages. HTML is used for building the pages’ structures, CSS is for styling the pages and JS is for programming them. In dealing with the pages’ structures, you find how different tags work, a page or a document could be a pure HTML or a mix of HTML, CSS and JS. Tags are these codes that are not displayed by the web browser, their major role is to tell the browser how contents must be displayed. HTML is considered to be the easiest language according to most web developers – those who perform web development. HTML alone will not give you awesome website, that’s why we have CSS for giving our website different designs according to what contents it holds. The real art begins when we are designing our website. We give emotions and feelings that match what messages our pages contain. We choose a colour scheme for attracting our visitors and users. We also use background images to portray more the purpose of our website and to give them positive impressions. In the programming part, we use JS to give our pages\' behaviours. How to react to different events triggered by the user or the page itself. What to do with forms, how to purify the data inside it and determine whether it has been properly filled in. JS is known to be the programming language of the web. It follows the functional programming paradigm. When we say functional programming, it means we mostly store the program’s procedures in functions to reduce code repetition, we call these functions if we want to execute their blocks of codes inside of them. Though JS highlights functional behaviour, we can still perform Object Orientation in this language. Object Oriented Programming is a paradigm that got its concept from real life objects. We consider the object’s behaviours through methods – what does the object do or perform, and states known as attributes – what does the object own besides from methods. What if your website accepts inputs from its users? Of course, you have to manage these inputs, it is either you just process them then forgetting them, or you might choose to store them. When dealing with the data, we recall this term called database, and if we need a database, we will work with a language for managing the database. The very well-known language for dealing with databases is SQL or Sequel. This resembles the English language for retrieving and storing data from and in the database. Web development is divided into two, the front-end and back-end. HTML, CSS and JS work in the front-end. In some situations, JS work in the back-end as well. Like the Node.JS, it is a JS framework that lets you develop JS-powered servers. The back-end part is the hardest because it is where you consider the rest of the works, from handling requests to keeping your database good – good, like not injected by malicious SQL commands to ruin it. Like what other programmers say – delete a table from someone’s database and he/she will experience a toothache. If there’s SQL, then what does govern it? The answer is server-side languages, like Python, ASP(dot)NET, Java and much more. But the most used is PHP which originally stood for Personal Homepage but later changed to Hypertext Processor. This programming language handles requests and processes them according to what they want. Ever wondered why the “echo” command is called “echo”? When you shout in a wide area with big and high structures around you, there is an echo, right? Your shout represents the request from the client-side, while the echo represents the response, the part where your shout ends or hits represents the server (take the big and high structure as examples). In every shout, there is an echo. Just like in every request, there is a response. Security starts from the request because it might contain malicious intention for gaining access to the database. Or it could be tons of requests, bombarding your web server and leading it to crash. The responses must only be given to known requests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Web development is very broad. But don’t get discouraged even if it’s really wide. Patience is the secret to success, not Google – it’s just one of the conventions. Web developers really earn good money. I had a professional web developer friend once, he does freelancing, and the down payment he gets from each project is never bellowed 50k pesos! What more if he finishes them all? I hope, some of us will become web developers someday, and they can say, “There is more fun in web development”.</p>\r\n\r\n</div>',preview_content:"Have you ever wondered how Facebook manages likes, thought how Instagram maintains their nice design or imagined how many programming languages were used in building Twitter?",views:30}]}],fetch:[],error:null,state:{photo:"https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/30485137?s=460&u=b5a13c4c462ef5aac3af7a68cb33097eb2772f42&v=4"},serverRendered:e,routePath:"/blog"}}(!0,"PB","https://denniel-sadian.github.io/img/elearning.jpg")</script><script src="/_nuxt/6eaee35e2c545980fe0e.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/a0d11d4a97feddd17115.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/72870df355576f5d6070.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/6fd78025157fef9e3630.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/7aeb380d034bc1f784a3.js" defer></script>
